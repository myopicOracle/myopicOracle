## The Simple Library 
*Constructors & Prototypes - 1st JavaScript Project (Dec. 2024)*

One of my first projects, and also easily one of the most memorable.

### Live Demo

[![Library App Screenshot](assets/simple-library-v2.png)](https://myopicoracle.github.io/prototypes-library/)

‚û°Ô∏è [Try the Live Demo](https://myopicoracle.github.io/prototypes-library/)

Built with vanilla JavaScript, this project was my first taste of OOP, getting some reps in for prototypal-inheritance, JS classes, constructor functions, DOM manipulation, and local storage.

### What I Learned

- Object-oriented programming with JavaScript classes and prototypes
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Form validation and data persistence
- Responsive web design principles
- Code organization and project structure
