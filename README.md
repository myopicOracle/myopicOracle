## **The Simple Library** 
*Constructors & Prototypes - 1st JavaScript Project (Dec. 2024)*

One of my first projects, and also easily one of the most memorable.

#### **Live Demo**

[![Library App Screenshot](/assets/simple-library-v2.png)](https://myopicoracle.github.io/prototypes-library/)

➡️ [Try the Live Demo](https://myopicoracle.github.io/prototypes-library/)

Built with vanilla JavaScript, this project was my first taste of OOP, getting some reps in for prototypal-inheritance, JS classes, constructor functions, DOM manipulation, and local storage.

#### What I Learned

- Object-oriented programming with JavaScript classes and prototypes
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Form validation and data persistence
- Responsive web design principles
- Code organization and project structure

## **The Joshua Tree Foundation: Sustainable Finance**  
*Non-Profit Sustainable Finance Inititative*

A comprehensive sustainability platform exploring carbon offset initiatives through innovative products like Carbon X-Trace™ and blockchain-backed NFTrees. Features in-depth analysis of carbon markets, Net Zero frameworks, and accessible environmental education through structured digital storytelling.

<!-- ![Voluntary Carbon Markets Thesis](assets/jtf-vision.png) -->

The Yucca Palms project, also known as The Joshua Tree Foundation, is a sustainable finance initiative that combines environmentalism with blockchain technology.

At its core, the project facilitates the planting of trees to sequester carbon dioxide. When you fund a tree, you receive a digital certificate of ownership in the form of an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), which they call an "NFTree." This token represents the physical tree and is recorded on a blockchain, also granting you a lease on the land where it grows.

As the tree matures and absorbs more CO2, you are intended to share in the benefits of the carbon offsets it generates. The project aims to operate within the voluntary carbon markets and is developing a suite of digital asset products, including a decentralized exchange for carbon credits.

**Focus:** Branding, Sustainable Finance, Fundraising, Sales & Marketing, Climate Tech, Blockchain
